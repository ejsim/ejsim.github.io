			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>Hey, I'm Edward. I'm currently a Junior at Tufts University studying Computer Science (Engineering) and Music Engineering. I was born in New Jersey in 1996 and I've lived there ever since. I'm interested in software development and cybersecurity. I also have a passion for music. I play a number of instruments, and I write and record my own material. I'm hoping to integrate these two fields with one another during my career.</p>
